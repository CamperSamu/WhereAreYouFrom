# Where Are You From?
> _Give credit where creditors do_

A serverside Fabric mod that adds the corresponding mod name to items in the lore.

## Why would you need this?
If you host a serverside modpack (via [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc) for example) mods like [REI](https://github.com/shedaniel/RoughlyEnoughItems) won't display the right mod name in the tooltip; this mod replicates the intended behaviour, even for Vanilla clients.
